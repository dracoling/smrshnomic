Bulletin 20130126-02: Death by a thousand papercuts
===================================================
Hello Voters,

We've had an astoundingly busy first 16 hours. This is honestly far
busier than I expected to be this soon, which is AWESOME.

It got a little confusing, in less than a day we had 16 proposals
and our first Call for Judgement. I'm going to try to summarize what
the current state of the game is, but each player is reminded that
it's up to them to keep up with developments in the game. This is
provided only as a convenience.

The current official rules have been published to 
https://github.com/dracoling/smrshnomic/blob/master/rules.current.md

Call for Judgement #001 was initiated by Speaker dracoling and 
Judgement was rendered by Will. The issue was duplicated rule numbers
caused by the formats of Proposals #303 and #307 which were withdrawn
as a result of the Judgement. The proposals were split in parts and 
re-submitted in valid form as Proposals #310-316.

The following Proposals are open for voting:
* #301 - Colin - Transmute Rule 210: Rule effect timing
* #302 - Colin - Amend Rule 211: Points distribution 
* #304 - the nameless one - Create Rule 304: Vote privacy and penalties
* #305 - Colin - Create Rule 305: Vote privacy (split options)
* #306 - Colin - Amend Rule 218: Speaker's duties
* #308 - Colin - Transmute Rule 109: Rule proposal numbering
* #309 - Colin - Amend Rule 207: Voting
* #310 - Colin - New Rule 310: Sub-proposals
* #311 - Colin - New Rule 311: Proposal withdrawal
* #312 - Colin - New Rule 312: Valid proposal content
* #313 - Colin - New Rule 313: Proposal amendment
* #314 - Colin - New Rule 314: Sponsor vote enforcement
* #315 - Colin - Amend Rule 214: Judge selection
* #316 - Colin - Amend Rule 216: Legal judgements

The following Proposals have been withdrawn:
* #303 - Colin - due to CfJ #001
* #307 - Colin - due to CfJ #001

Proposals of special note:
* Proposal #305 requires a vote of "A", "B", or "NO"
* Proposal #309 could change the voting period.

Current Players: 
* dracoling [Speaker]
* Colin 
* the nameless one
* James
* Will

The players list as well as all proposals and judgements are 
available on the GitHub website for this Nomic. As the game evolves 
I will try to keep this information up to date, but the official 
record is the list and it's archive.
