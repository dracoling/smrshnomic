This proposal creates a new rule with the following text:

    Submitting a proposal which contains sub-proposals shall cost the 
    submitting player 5 points, regardless of the success of the proposal 
    or its sub-proposals.

This proposal adjusts Colin's score by -5

__Speaker's Comment:__ 
{
  
    I see nothing in the rules controlling how to deal with withdrawing
    proposals. In the "spirit" of the current game I've decided that this
    should be allowed. There is no allowance or provision for any penalty
    to be assessed for non-rule actions, so this action will be completed
    without official penalty.
    
    Proposal #309 and #310 are officially withdrawn at this time without
    penalty by the request of their proposer and by order of the Speaker.
