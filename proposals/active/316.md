__Proposal:__
{

This proposal uses the following definitions:

    * disagreeing party - any voter, speaker or group which disagrees 
      with another such party about the legality of a move or the 
      interpretation or application of a rule.
    * legal Judge candidate - any voter or speaker who is not a member of 
      a disagreeing party in the disagreement being judged.

This proposal amends rule 216. Append the following text to it:

    If a Judge returns the verdict UNDECIDED and at least one legal Judge 
    candidate has not yet acted as Judge in this disagreement, then a new 
    Judge shall be selected as though a verdict had not been returned, and 
    shall return a verdict as required by all relevant rules.

}

__Speaker's Comments:__

    I think if this passes we're going to have to refactor the rules to include a dictionary section.
