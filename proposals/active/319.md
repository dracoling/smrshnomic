__Proposal:__
{

This proposal creates a new rule with the following text:

    All documents shall be dated with an official dating format.

}

__Speaker's Comments:__
{

    Currently, there's no confusion in any of our official dates because I
    use ISO standard YYYY-MM-DD for all dates. At this time this proposal
    fails to define what an official format is.
