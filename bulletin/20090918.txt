20090918 - smrshnomic bulletin #1 - It Starts

Welcome to smrshnomic, you have been drafted as a Voter in this engaging[1] 
and highly successful[2] game!

As a Voter, you will have the opportunity to both vote on and propose changes 
to the current rules.
 (always available at http://github.com/dracoling/smrshnomic )

The goal of the game is to win the game by any means possible, and the rules 
of the game are the way to win!

To begin the game I will submit the following proposal, beginning today I will 
accept proposals. Each proposal will be distributed to all players in the 
bulletin following its reception. All rules accepted by previous votes will be 
enacted at the time of the next bulletin (the rules will be updated at most 
once per day).

Please submit your votes on the following proposal and any other proposals to 
me asap.

Proposal #301 by dracoling: 
I propose that we edit rule #206 to contain the following text:
  Each Voter has exactly one vote. The Speaker has exactly 1.5 votes.

* [1]: I hope you will play, and therefore be engaged.
* [2]: Only you can prevent forest fires... and make this successful... so do 
it. (Or I set the bear on fire)
