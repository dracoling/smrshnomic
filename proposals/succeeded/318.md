__Proposal:__
{

This proposal creates a new rule with the following text:

    Whenever a proposal is submitted, the submitter must also post the 
    most interesting thing that has happened to them in the 24 hours 
    prior to the submission of the proposal, else the submitter must 
    sacrifice 10 points.
    
    What is considered "the most interesting thing" is at the discretion 
    of the submitter.
    
    If multiple proposals are made within any 24 hour period, then a 
    "most interesting thing" may be reused, providing it still happened 
    within the 24 hours prior to the submission of the new proposal(s).
