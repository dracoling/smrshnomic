Bulletin 20130131-01: Vote early and vote often
===================================================
Hi Voters,

__Random statistic time!__  
With the exception of proposal #320 (due to its introduction
yesterday) there are now at least 2 votes on each proposal, each
proposal has at most 4 recorded votes, only one proposal has a
unanimous vote.  
NOW YOU KNOW!

New since yesterday: 
Proposal #320 has been added.
Proposals #309 and #310 have been withdrawn.

I'm going to try to summarize what the current state of the game is,
but each player is reminded that it's up to them to keep up with
developments in the game. This is provided only as a convenience.

The current official rules are published at
