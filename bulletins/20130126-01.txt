Bulletin 20130126-01: The Foot is a Game!
==================================
Welcome Voters!

Seeing that there are now more than three other members of the list
and that the clock has struck the appointed hour, I hereby declare
the game open.

Step 1: Introduce thineself!
Step 2: Change the rules
Step 3: ????
Step 4: Profit!

The current rules have been copied to 
https://github.com/dracoling/smrshnomic/blob/master/rules.current.md

Please note that under the current rules a proposal is not valid for
voting until it has been assigned a number and that the voting period
shall be one week from the time the Speaker distributes the proposal
to all players.

I await your commands with glee.
