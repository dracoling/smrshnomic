__Proposal:__
{

This proposal creates a new rule with the following text:

    All official documents shall be dated with the day-month-year format, 
    where day is a two digit number 00-31, mouth is a three letter abbr. 
    of the month, and year is a four digit number.

This is to avoid confusion between m/d/y and d/m/y.

I promise my next proposal will be more 'fun'.

}

__Speaker's Comments:__
{

    Thou shalt not steal the speakers job!
    
    Also, there's no confusion in any of our official dates because I use 
    ISO standard YYYY-MM-DD for all dating format. 
    
    Personal opinion: I think your day month year format is icky. Also, 
    how do we abbreviate the "mouth" of January?
