__Proposal:__
{

This proposal uses the following definitions:

    * disagreeing party - any voter, speaker or group which disagrees 
      with another such party about the legality of a move or the 
      interpretation or application of a rule.
    * legal Judge candidate - any voter or speaker who is not a member of 
      a disagreeing party in the disagreement being judged.

This proposal amends rule 214. Strike its text and replace it with 
the following:

    If judgement was invoked by a Voter, then the first Judge to be 
    selected to judge that statement shall be the Speaker. If judgement 
    was invoked by the Speaker, the first Judge to be selected shall be 
    a randomly selected legal Judge candidate.
    
    In all cases, if a Judge beyond the first must be selected to judge a 
    statement, it shall be a randomly selected legal Judge candidate. The 
    legal Judge candidate thus selected may not be the player most 
    recently selected as Judge for that statement.

}

__Speaker's Comments:__

    I think if this passes we're going to have to refactor the rules to include a dictionary section.
