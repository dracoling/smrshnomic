Call for Judgement #001
=======================
* Judge: Will
* Invoked by: dracoling
* Finding: TRUE

__Original Call:__
{

    According to my reading of rule #109 the proposals numbered 303 and 307 would cause an invalid game state due to duplicated rule numbers. 

    These proposals would have the following effect on the rule numbers:
     Proposal #303:
     * Rule 214 becomes Rule 303
     * Rule 216 becomes Rule 303
     Proposal #307:
     * 5 new rules, each numbered Rule 307
  
    Due to the early state of the game and lack of rules specifically forbidding or allowing for removal of proposals, I propose that if this this judgement be found TRUE that these proposals should be withdrawn from consideration without penalty to their author. 

}

__Judge's Finding:__
{

    The judge finds this judgement to be TRUE. The conflicting proposals
    should be withdrawn without penalty to their author.

}

Notes:

    Withdrew Proposal #303
    Withdrew Proposal #307
