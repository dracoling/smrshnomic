{

This proposal amends rule 207. Append the following to its third sentence:

    ", or until all votes necessary to determine the outcome have been cast. 
    If a majority of votes have been received, and the outcome may be 
    determined from those votes alone, its voting period shall be ended 
    immediately."

}

__Speaker's Comment:__ 
{
  
    I see nothing in the rules controlling how to deal with withdrawing
    proposals. In the "spirit" of the current game I've decided that this
    should be allowed. There is no allowance or provision for any penalty
    to be assessed for non-rule actions, so this action will be completed
    without official penalty.
    
    Proposal #309 and #310 are officially withdrawn at this time without
    penalty by the request of their proposer and by order of the Speaker.
