__Proposal:__
{

This proposal amends Rule 214 to the following:

    If judgement was invoked by a Voter, then the first Judge to be
    selected to judge that statement shall be a Voter randomly
    selected by the Speaker.
    
    In all cases, if a Judge beyond the first must be selected to
    judge a statement, it shall be a randomly selected Voter. The
    Voter thus selected may not be the player most recently selected
    as Judge for that statement, nor may be the player who invoked
    judgement.

}

__Proposer's Comment:__

    As pointed out by Renning, any judgement called by a Voter can
    technically be rejected by a Speaker straight away, and it makes
    me feel like I live in Pyongyang. This change should mean that
    although any judgement can still be rejected instantly, it's not
    done by the Speaker so spreads the power among Voters a bit more.
    
    I haven't explicitly said that the Judge can't be the Speaker so
    that if someone decides to shake things up a bit and change rule
    103 to mean that a Speaker can also be a Voter, then this rule is
    affected.

}

__Speaker's Comment:__ 
{

    Because this proposal affects the duties required of the
    Speaker, and the Speaker DOES NOT CONSENT to this change, this
    proposal requires a 2/3 majority of votes cast to succeed.
