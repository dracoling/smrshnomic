__Proposal:__
{

This proposal creates a new rule:

    In order for a vote to be legally casted via email, it must be sent directly to the Speaker, without anyone else visibly copied or addressed on that email. Attaching a BCC to that email is illegal unless the BCC is directly acknowledged in the body of the email (acknowledging the recipient is not required, merely the fact that there is a BCC). Any player found to have violated this rule is immediately disqualified from the game and may be forbidden to return to future games at the discretion of the current Speaker.
