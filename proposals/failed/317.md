__Proposal:__
{

This proposal creates a new rule with the following text:
    
    All dated articles henceforth shall use Universal Coordinate Time.

NYC time is no longer applicable because of an increase in players not
from NYC. Continued use of NYC time would only serve to alienate none
NYC players.

Should this proposal be accepted, any articles dated prior to the
acceptance of this proposal shall remain valid.

}

__Speaker's Comments:__
{

    Great, if this passes I have to keep track of transition time zones. 
    Thanks Will! :-P
