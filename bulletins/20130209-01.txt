Bulletin 20130209-01: Still crazy after all these years
=================================================== 
Important changes to the game: 
Proposal content and sections have been formalized (Rule #321).
Abstaining now grants points to the author of a proposal whether that
proposal passes or not (Rule #326). Proposals must include commentary
on why the proposal will enhance the game (Rule #327).

Please note that the first application of Rule #326 was for the 
counting of votes in Rule #327.

The following proposals have been decided.
