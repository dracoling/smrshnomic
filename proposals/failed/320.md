__Proposal:__
{

This proposal amends rule 203, replacing it with the following text:

    The winner is the first Voter to achieve 100 (positive) points. If
    more than one Voter achieves this condition simultaneously, all such
    Voters win.
    
    When a game ends in this manner:
    
    * If there is only one winner, that Voter has the option to become the
      Speaker, or to have a randomly selected Voter become the Speaker. In
      this case, neither the old Speaker nor the winning Voter shall be
      eligible to be randomly selected.
    
    * If there is more than one winner, the Speaker randomly selects one
      of the winners, who has the option to refuse to become the Speaker. In
      this case, the Speaker randomly chooses one of the remaining winners,
      who is given the same option. This continues until there are no longer
      any winners left. If the final winner opts to not become the Speaker,
      then the Speaker randomly chooses a Voter from the non-winning Voters.
      If there are no remaining eligible Voters, then the game is over.
    
    * All players' scores are reset to 0.
    
    * A new game is begun. All rules and proposed rule changes retain the
      status they had at the end of the old game.
