Bulletin 20130130-01: How quiet the chamber is
===================================================
Hi Voters,

You're all still out there, right? The list was strangely silent 
yesterday, so the summary below is basically the same as it was 
previously. Don't forget that the voting closes soon on the first
batch of proposals, but there's still time to sneak your friends
into the game so they can vote too. In the interest of fairness I 
think that people will have to be introduced into the game at least
24 hours before a vote closes in order to vote in that period. 

I'm going to try to summarize what the current state of the game is,
but each player is reminded that it's up to them to keep up with
developments in the game. This is provided only as a convenience.

The current official rules are published at 
https://github.com/dracoling/smrshnomic/blob/master/rules.current.md
