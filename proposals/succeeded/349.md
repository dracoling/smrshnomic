__Proposal:__
{

    Repeal rule #304

}

__Proposer's Comment:__
{
  
    This rule is harmful to the game because it allows accidental
    disqualification and does not otherwise enhance play in any way.
    
    Oh yeah. "an image of tits" is hereby included in my proposal to 
    request a reduced voting period.

}

__Speaker's Comment:__
{
  
    This rule change is valid because rule #105 states that a rule
    change can include repeal. Rule #321 conflicts with Rule #105 but
    Rule #105 wins (due to precedence [Rule #111]).
    
    Don't do it for me... do it for your country!
