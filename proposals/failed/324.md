__Proposal:__
{

This proposal creates a new rule with the following text:

    A player may give any number of their points to another player by
    sending a message to the Speaker declaring their intention to do so,
    the number of points, and the player to receive them. The Speaker
    must, after applying the changes in point totals, announce the
    transaction to all players.
