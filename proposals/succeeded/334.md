__Proposal:__
{

This proposal creates a new rule with the following text:

    The voting period shall be granted a reduction to three days
    beginning at the time the Speaker distributes the proposal to all
    players if the proposal submitter provides to the players, at the
    time of proposal submission, an appropriate token for voting
    period reduction.
    
    A token for voting period reduction is found to be appropriate if
    less than a majority of players object to the token's
    appropriateness.
    
    A token for voting period reduction found to be inappropriate
    will result in the submitter losing 10 points and having their
    voting period reduction revoked.
    
    The token for voting period reduction must be an image of tits.
