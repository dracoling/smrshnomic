Immutable Rules
===============

* '101.' All players must always abide by all the rules then in
  effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in
  the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
  The Initial Set consists of rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-219
  (mutable).

* '102.' Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the
  200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that
  is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be
  immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the
  Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

* '104.' The Speaker for the first game shall be __dracoling__.

* '105.' A rule change is any of the following: (1) the enactment,
  repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; or (2) the transmutation of
  an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

  (Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new
  rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable,
  may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are
  mutable, may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be
  transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune to change.)

* '106.' All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted
  on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
  number of votes and quorum is achieved.

* '107.' Any proposed rule change must be written down (or otherwise
  communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted, it
  must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

* '108.' No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of
  the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
  explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive
  application.

* '110.' Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable
  rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among
  votes legally cast. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
  stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

* '111.' In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the
  immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be
  entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to
  transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable
  rule.

* '112.' The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be
  altered from achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The
  magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed, and
  rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be
  enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

* '113.' A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather
  than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse
  than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be
  imposed.

* '114.' There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption
  of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.

* '115.' Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule
  changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes
  that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule
  change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the
  self-reference or self-application of a rule.

* '116.' Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is
  permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the
  rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules
  explicitly or implicitly permits it.

Mutable rules
===============

* '202.' All players begin with 0 points. Points may not be gained,
  lost, or traded except as explicitly stated in the rules.

* '203.' The winner is the first Voter to achieve 100 (positive)
  points. If more than one Voter achieves this condition
  simultaneously, all such Voters win.

  When a game ends in this manner:

  * If there is only one winner, that Voter becomes the Speaker, and
    the old Speaker becomes a Voter

  * If there is more than one winner, the Speaker randomly selects
    one of the winners, who becomes the new Speaker, and the old
    Speaker becomes a Voter. 
  
  * All players' scores are reset to 0. 
  
  * A new game is begun. All rules and proposed rule changes retain
    the status they had at the end of the old game.

* '205.' The prescribed voting period for a proposal shall be one
  week, beginning at the time the Speaker distributes the proposal to
  all players.

* '207.' Voters may vote either for or against any proposal within
  its prescribed voting period. In order to be legally cast, the vote
  must be received by the Speaker by the end of the prescribed voting
  period. The Speaker may not reveal any votes until the end of the
  prescribed voting period. Any Voter who does not legally vote
  within the prescribed voting period shall be deemed to have
  abstained.

* '208.' At the end of the prescribed voting period on a proposal,
  the Speaker shall reveal all votes legally cast on that proposal.
  If the Speaker's consent may be required for a proposal to be
  adopted, then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
  not e gives eir consent. If the Speaker does not explicitly
  indicate that e refuses to consent to the proposal, it shall be
  assumed that e consents.

* '209.' The required votes for a proposal to be adopted is as
  follows:

  For a proposal which would directly alter the actions which are
  required of and/or forbidden to the Speaker:

  a) a simple majority of all votes legally cast, if the Speaker
     consents; 

  b) a 2/3 majority of all votes legally cast, if the Speaker does
     not consent;

  For all other proposals, a simple majority of votes legally cast.
  This rule defers to rules which set the required number of votes
  for proposals which propose to transmute a rule.

* '210.' An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of
  the completion of the vote that adopted it.

* '211.' Voters who voted against proposals which are adopted receive
  10 points apiece. Players whose proposals are adopted shall receive
  a random number of points in the range 1-10 inclusive. Players
  whose proposals are not adopted shall lose 10 points.

* '212.' If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or
  if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the
  rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

  If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
  that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes
  precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such
  provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
  precedence.

  If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or
  defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

* '213.' If players disagree about the legality of a move or the
  interpretation or application of a rule, then a player may invoke
  judgement by submitting a statement for judgement to the Speaker.
  Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the
  insistence of any player. When judgement is invoked, the Speaker
  must, as soon as possible, select a Judge as described in the
  Rules. The Speaker must then distribute the statement to be judged,
  along with the identity of the Judge, to all players.

* '214.' If judgement was invoked by a Voter, then the first Judge to
  be selected to judge that statement shall be the Speaker. If
  judgement was invoked by the Speaker, the first Judge to be
  selected shall be a randomly selected Voter.

  In all cases, if a Judge beyond the first must be selected to judge
  a statement, it shall be a randomly selected Voter. The Voter thus
  selected may not be the player most recently selected as Judge for
  that statement, nor may e be the player who invoked judgement.

* '215.' After the Speaker has distributed the statement to be judged
  and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week in which to
  deliver a legal judgement. If the Judge fails to deliver a
  judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points and a new
  Judge is selected. A judgement is delivered by submitting that
  judgement to the Speaker, who must then distribute that judgement
  to all players as soon as possible.

* '216.' A legal judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED. The
  judgement may be accompanied by reasons and arguments, but such
  reasons and arguments form no part of the judgement itself. If a
  judgement is accompanied by reasons and arguments, the Speaker must
  distribute the reasons and arguments along with the judgement.

* '217.' All judgements must be in accordance with the rules;
  however, if the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
  statement to be judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom
  and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

* '218.' In addition to duties which may be listed elsewhere in the
  rules, the Speaker shall have the following duties:

  * register new players

  * maintain a list of all players and their current scores, and make
    such a list available to all players

  * maintain a complete list of the current rules, and make such a
    list available to all players

  * make a random determination whenever such determination is
    required by the rules.

* '219.' If a player believes that the rules are such that further
  play is impossible, or that the legality of a move cannot be
  determined with finality, or that a move appears equally legal and
  illegal, then the player may invoke judgement on a statement to
  that effect. If the statement is judged TRUE, then the player who
  invoked judgement shall be declared the winner of that game, and
  the game ends, with no provision for starting another game.

  This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the
  winner of the game.

* '305.' All votes cast shall be anonymous, and may not be revealed,
  except at the discretion of the Voter.

* '318.' Whenever a proposal is submitted, the submitter must also
  post the most interesting thing that has happened to them in the 24
  hours prior to the submission of the proposal, else the submitter
  must sacrifice 10 points.

  What is considered "the most interesting thing" is at the
  discretion of the submitter.

  If multiple proposals are made within any 24 hour period, then a
  "most interesting thing" may be reused, providing it still happened
  within the 24 hours prior to the submission of the new proposal(s).

* '326.' When votes are counted, the submitter of a proposal shall
  gain 3 points for each voter who abstained from voting.

* '327.' When submitting a proposal, the submitter must include
  commentary describing why they feel the proposal will enhance the
  game.

* '329.' In all formal communication between voters/speaker all
  documents shall use UTC time.

* '334.' The voting period shall be granted a reduction to three days
  beginning at the time the Speaker distributes the proposal to all
  players if the proposal submitter provides to the players, at the
  time of proposal submission, an appropriate token for voting period
  reduction.

  A token for voting period reduction is found to be appropriate if
  less than a majority of players object to the token's
  appropriateness.

  A token for voting period reduction found to be inappropriate will
  result in the submitter losing 10 points and having their voting
  period reduction revoked.

  The token for voting period reduction must be an image of tits.

* '338.' Quorum for a proposed rule change is defined to be one Voter 
  at the beginning of the prescribed voting period for that proposal

* '339.' Each Voter has exactly one vote. The Speaker may have 
  exactly one vote.

* '340.' The Speaker may propose a 'Slush Fund' action at any time e
  would be able to submit a legal proposal. Once announced, all
  players have 48 hours to attempt to "Abort" this action before it
  occurs. If a simple majority of active players choose to abort the
  action it does not occur and my not be proposed again until after
  the prescribed voting period for a proposal has elapsed at least
  once.

  When the Slush Fund action occurs, each player's points are divided
  by 2. One half is kept by the player, the other half is added to
  the Slush Fund. This Slush Fund is then divided by the number of
  active players and each is awarded an equal share of the points in
  the Slush Fund.

* '343.' At any time, each player shall be either a Voter or the
  Speaker; no player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At
  any time there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "player" in
  the rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
  Speaker.

* '344.' The Speaker shall give each proposed rule change a number
  for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule
  change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive
  integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

  If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of
  the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted,
  it receives the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it.

* '347.' If a player says "Right right?" All player must respond
  "Right!".
  
  Those that respond get 1 point. Those that do not get -1 point.
  You have 24hrs to respond.

* '350.' A proposal may contain any number of each of the following
  sections:

  * a rule creation section  
    This type of section defines a new rule

  * a rule amendment section  
    This type of section amends an existing, mutable rule (which must
    be mutable when the proposal is submitted)

  * a rule transmutation section  
    This type of section makes an existing immutable rule mutable, or 
    an existing mutable rule immutable

  * a score change section  
    This type of section changes the score of a named player (or 
    players) to a specific value or by a specific amount when it is 
    passed

  * a sub-proposal containing any section legal in a proposal except 
    for sub-proposals  
    This type of section is only useful in multiples, and defines 
    multiple competing alternatives for a subject

  * a rule renumbering section  
    This type of section renumbers an existing rule.

  * A rule deletion section
    This type of section deletes an existing, mutable rule.
